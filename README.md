# Motor Imagery
Project to analyze the accuracy of multiple algorithms published in papers about EEG binary motor imagery problem.

The motor imagery (MI) based BCI is capable of translating the Subjectâ€™s movement intention 
to controls the external devices. Imagining a movement or performing an action mentally is
known as MI. In MI tasks, subjects are instructed to imagine themselves performing a specific
motor action (e.g. hand, foot) without overt motor output and each task is treated as a MI class.

# Notes
* Was noted that in the covariance matrices estimation in the CSP algorithm, is better to use metric 
logeuclid or euclid instead riemman, because the accuracy is practically the same, and the riemman is much slower.
