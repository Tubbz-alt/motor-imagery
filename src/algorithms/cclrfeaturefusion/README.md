Implementation based on the article:
Modified CC-LR algorithm with three diverse
feature sets for motor imagery tasks classification
in EEG based brainâ€“computer interface

As the motor cortex area of the brain is typically associated 
to the MI movements with the EEG position C3 in the international 
10/20 system for electrode placement, so C3 channel can provide more
information about brain activities during the MI tasks.

The study considers C3 channel as a reference channel for the CC method.

The reference channel of a class is cross-correlated with the data of the
remaining channels of the current class and the data of all
channels of any other classes.

The graphical presentation of a cross-correlation sequence is called a cross-correlogram.
